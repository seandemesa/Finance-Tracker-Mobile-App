what i have:

(7/12/2021) [Monday]

- working dummy fetch call with day press


(7/13/2021) [Tuesday]
- mongoDB DB & collection (table) is up, running, and connected to server

- multiple fetch calls work

- can retrieve data from DB & insert hardcoded data but not insert data thats been sent from client / front-end


(7/14/2021) [Wednesday]

- on day press will retrieve info of day from DB

- can submit from modal to DB; following submission page is re-rendering with new submission


(7/15/2021) [Thursday]
- userInfo collection in DB

- upon insertion to DB, password is encrypted on server, and can be validated upon request (i.e. login)

(7/16/2021) [Friday]
- drawer navigator works with stack navigator, has replaced stack as main

- fixed problems with navigators (decent amount)

- log out button 


(7/18/2021) [Sunday]
-username stored in async storage

-simple query for amount spent for current month


(7/19/2021) [Monday]
- header & button to open drawer (separate button for "mainStack" but feels and works normally)

- modal to create recurring payment submission which inserts into new DB "recurringPayments"

- alot of mental problem solving (such as to accomplish established code but with less calls to DB overall and only when necessary)
	- (laid foundation to eventually add recurring payment to proper DB)
	- (laid foundation to eventually have marked dates on calendar)


 (7/20/2021) [Tuesday]
- recurring payment will add into paymentInfo collection upon new recurring payment

- automatic payment submissions

- marked dates on calendar for payments (1 dot color for regular payments, another for re-occuring, etc.)


(7/21/2021) [Wednesday]

- change how data is handled w/ calendar (i.e. not with a fetch but from the data gathered from the 1 big fetch)

- edit button for payments

- show existing recurring payments in your profile

- new recurring payment will not only add into paymentInfo collection but now show on calendar with marked dates

- changed submitPayment from modal on dayInfo.js to its own screen. not sure if it was necessary but it works *shrug*


(7/22/2021) [Thursday]

- some documentation 

- new input design for login & createAccount (buttons still same)

- editing payments is more responsive (i.e. no need for "reset")

- payments on day are more organized via ListItem and swipeable element to edit. recurring payments also have "loop" icon
to signify recurring payment

- included a "total spent on day" for dayInfo (new route.param)

- recurring payments on yourProfile.js are more organized via ListItem

- delete option for regular payments (responsive)


(7/23/2021) [Friday]

- cleaned up code slightly by moving creation of "needToRefreshCalendar" & "needToRefreshYourProfile" to login

- bug fixing (new recurring payment will add payment and show on calendar along w/ appropriate dots)


(7/24/2021) [Saturday]

- edit & delete option for recurring payments w/ option to edit/delete, respectively, the payment for the current month


(7/25/2021) [Sunday]

- dots fixed (have a recurring payment be dominant over regular)

- some more documentation


(7/26/2021) [Monday] (2 WEEK MARK)

- prevent adding / editing recurring payments that already exist

- updated inputs for recurring payment modal and fixed keyboard not covering up inputs in submitPayment & recurringPayment

- replaced notifications page with "search" page which allows uer to search for amount spent on X (e.g. starbucks) within
 2 specific dates


------------------------
***ABOUT A WEEK BREAK***
------------------------



(8/1/2021) [Sunday] 
[BUG FIXING BASICALLY]
- fixed bug of dots not working unless u had recurring payment (fix: assign dates w/ marked payments array regardless if there is a recurring
payment or not

- fixed payment of day to be responsive on edit/add (already worked on delete)

- made current amount payed for month in your profile work w/ recurring payments

- fixed update to not only check by id if its a new addition ( because at that point we hadn't
retrieved the item's ID) [need to fix for update on recurringP & delete's]



(8/2/2021) [Monday]
[MORE BUG FIXING]
- made insertion of "month" more consistent across the board (i.e. if its below 10, it should enter just the number
but add the 0 for the date string(e.g. month: 8, date: 2021-08-XX))

- amount payed for this month on your profile now responsive
(fix: i only relied on getting the amount thru the initial fetch but most times i changed the array
"recurring payments" i also did for monthlyAmountPayed, idk why i hadn't before, i forgot when you add a
reccuring payment it doesn't add payment to paymentInfo till back on calendar)

- update now works on a brand new payment without having to go back to calendar 
(had to mess w/ queries & ID since if you make 1 and try to delete/update prior to going to calendar,
it didn't have an id to check for but now we have temp which is the actual one )

- fixed bug where when you tried to add a new payment after a deletion it wouldnt show up, but after 
calendar then go back it shows up (needed to send over right array to submitPayment)

- fixed bug where deleting a recurring payment after updating it then subsequently deleting its payment
from current month wouldn't delete from paymentInfo but did in recurringPayments (because when I thought
all months were consistent across the board (see first bug fix of this day) it wasnt...)

- FINALLY fixed bug where if you tried to edit a payment immediately after addition it would update, but then if you went to calendar
it was still the old data, and when you went back to your profile it was also still old data (had2 mess around with the return value
of the "insertedID" from the result of the fetch call )

- fixed update recurring payment with new parentID



- KNOWN BUG I DONT REALLY WANT TO FIX: when you add a recurring payment, then subsequently delete it,
and choose option to not delete payment in current month, monthly amount spent stays the same, but
we never added anything to DB in the first place.



first addition of new recurring payment doubling in cur amt payed for month???


what's next: (in terms of importance)

- organize payments on day by payment, or by time, etc.

- more documentation

- validation on payment submission forms & for login

- look pretty (cards, fonts, buttons, headers, etc.)

- custom notifications if surpassed over X dollars (in general or on something specific like coffee for example)

- custom queries??? (e.g. check amount payed from date X to date Y)
